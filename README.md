# OLRM-V1
Organisation Level Reconnisance Methodology is an attack surface mapping framework that helps you to demonstrate how much an APT group can enumerate your organization. Reconnaissance is the information-gathering stage of hacking, where attackers collects data about the target system. This data can include anything from network infrastructure to employee contact details. The goal of reconnaissance is to identify as many potential attack vectors as possible. 

## Phases:
This methodology is divided into three phases:
1. Organization:
Collecting information regarding anything related to the Organization. This includes child companies, subdomains, or any labeled asset owned by the organization.
2. Expanding Attack Surface:
Analyze Collected Information and expand the scope.
3. Single Host:
Enumerating a single host
